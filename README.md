# Error Reproduction

Simply press/hold on chart and pan left and right. Performance on physical device with this application is acceptable but notice how much slower it is relative to simulator. This is also a very very lightweight application which helps with performance. In a more complicated application, especially one which uses redux for cross-component communication, this performance is significantly lower.
